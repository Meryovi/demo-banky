## Banky

### Overview

Banky is a demo application designed to showcase my skills in using .NET, React, and Tailwind CSS. This project demonstrates a vertical slices/modular monolith approach while adhering to clean architecture principles.

In the client, it leverages TanStack Query to handle client/server state synchronization, utilizing techniques such as optimistic updates to improve responsiveness.

The application is a very minimal banking-focused application, where the user can open accounts, transfer funds between them and close them when not longer needed.

### Technologies Used

- **.NET 9**
- **React 19**
- **Tailwind CSS 4**

Part of my goal was to keep the stack clean and use a relatively low number of dependencies. This is usually my approach in real life. :)

### Architecture

The application follows a vertical slices/modular monolith approach in both the client and server layers, which helps in maintaining a clean separation of concerns and promotes scalability. The clean architecture principles are implemented to ensure that the core business logic is independent of external technologies.
