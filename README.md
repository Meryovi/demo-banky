## Banky

### Overview

Banky is a demo application designed to showcase my skills in using .NET, React, and Tailwind CSS. This project demonstrates a vertical slices/modular monolith approach while adhering to clean architecture principles.

On the client side, it leverages TanStack Query to handle client/server state synchronization, utilizing techniques such as optimistic updates to improve responsiveness.

The application is a minimal banking-focused application, where users can open accounts, transfer funds between them, and close accounts when no longer needed.

### Technologies Used

- **.NET 9**
- **React 19**
- **Tailwind CSS 4**

Part of my goal was to keep the stack clean and use a relatively low number of dependencies. This is usually my approach in real-life projects. :)

### Architecture

The application follows a vertical slices/modular monolith approach in both the client and server layers, which helps in maintaining a clean separation of concerns and promotes scalability. Clean architecture and DDD principles are implemented to ensure that the core business logic is independent of external technologies.
